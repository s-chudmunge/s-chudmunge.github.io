                    <p>I am interested in understanding how complex behavior emerges in quantum and many-body systems. My work explores the connections between condensed matter physics, quantum information, and statistical mechanics, where collective effects, entanglement, and topology reveal new ways of thinking about matter and information.</p>
                    
                    <p>I use theoretical analysis and computational modeling to study these systems, with a particular interest in how modern computational and information-based approaches can deepen our understanding of quantum phases and correlations. I am also interested in how experimental advances can test and inspire new theoretical frameworks.</p>
                    
                    <p>Recently, I have been studying phenomena related to edge states and quantum phase transitions in extended spin models, as part of a broader interest in emergent and topological behavior.</p>
                    
                    <p>What motivates me most is the search for unifying ideas that connect different areas of physics and help us see familiar systems from a new perspective.</p>
