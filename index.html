                    <h3>My Journey</h3>
                    <p>I completed my B.Sc. in Physics from Shivaji University, Kolhapur (2018-2021), where I developed a strong foundation in theoretical physics and mathematics. After qualifying JAM 2022 with an All India Rank of 768, I pursued my M.Sc. in Physics (Computational Physics) at IIT Palakkad (2022-2024).</p>

                    <p>During my master's, I worked on quantum many-body systems, exploring Majorana zero modes in extended quantum Ising chains under the guidance of Dr. K. Dhochak. This research involved developing numerical simulations using Python, implementing Jordan-Wigner and Bogoliubov-de-Gennes transformations, and characterizing topological phase transitions through winding number calculations. I also studied quantum spin models and phase transitions, computing magnetization and correlation functions through analytical and numerical methods.</p>

                    <p>Beyond research, I've built computational systems like Menttor, a free learning platform with adaptive recommendation algorithms, using Python, FastAPI, PostgreSQL, and modern web technologies. I currently work in Academic R&D at PhysicsWallah, where I integrate ML-ready datasets for educational research.</p>

                    <p>Through my work in computational physics—numerical simulations, algorithm optimization, and data analysis—I've developed strong expertise in scientific programming, numerical methods, and problem-solving. These skills, combined with my physics background in wave phenomena, Fourier analysis, and mathematical modeling, have sparked my interest in applying computational approaches to real-world engineering challenges.</p>

                    <h3>Research Interests</h3>
                    <p>I am interested in applying signal processing, machine learning, and computational methods to problems in electrical and computer engineering, particularly at the intersection of physics and engineering applications.</p>

                    <p><strong>Medical Imaging and MRI:</strong> I am fascinated by magnetic resonance imaging as it combines electromagnetic theory, signal processing, and inverse problems. I'm interested in MRI reconstruction algorithms, k-space sampling strategies, parallel imaging techniques, and quantitative imaging methods. The mathematical foundations—Fourier transforms, optimization, and inverse problems—align naturally with my computational physics background.</p>

                    <p><strong>Signal Processing and RF Systems:</strong> My experience with Fourier analysis and wave phenomena has drawn me to signal processing, including filter design, time-frequency analysis, wavelet transforms, and their applications in communication systems. I'm also interested in RF systems, electromagnetic wave propagation, and antenna design, where physics principles directly translate to engineering solutions.</p>

                    <p><strong>Machine Learning in Engineering:</strong> I want to explore deep learning applications in signal and image processing, particularly for inverse problems, reconstruction tasks, compressed sensing, and pattern recognition. The intersection of numerical optimization, data-driven methods, and physical modeling presents exciting opportunities for advancing these fields.</p>

                    <p>What drives me is the opportunity to leverage mathematical and computational tools to solve tangible engineering problems—whether improving medical diagnostics through better imaging, designing efficient communication systems, or developing intelligent signal processing algorithms. My goal is to contribute to research that bridges theoretical foundations with practical applications in next-generation technologies.</p>
